# azure-math-func
The program has three functions, which can be called with https://\<Domain-Name\>/api/\<Function\>/?\<Attribute\>=\<Value\> <br>
The domain name is in my case https://javamathfunctions.azurewebsites.net <br>
The functions are primeFactors, factorial, pi <br>
Attribute for primeFactors and factorial is "number" and for pi "digits" <br>
The value for all numbers is a whole positive number <br>
<br>
If the function needs longer than 20 seconds, it kills itself.
